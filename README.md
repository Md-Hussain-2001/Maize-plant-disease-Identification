<p>Welcome to my Maize Plant Disease Identification project! 🌱 This is an end-to-end machine learning-based solution designed to help farmers and agricultural enthusiasts identify diseases in maize plants quickly and accurately. By leveraging the power of Computer Vision and Deep Learning, this project aims to make plant disease detection accessible and user-friendly.

🛠️ How It Works
Image Input: Users can upload an image of a maize plant.

Disease Detection: The trained model analyzes the image and predicts the disease (if any).

Results: The application displays the identified disease along with relevant information to help users take appropriate action.</p>
